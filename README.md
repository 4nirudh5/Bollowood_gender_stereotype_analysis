# Bollowood gender stereotype analysis
## Finding:
The presence of gender stereotypes in many aspects of society is a well-known phenomenon in Indian movies.


## The dataset is collected from : https://github.com/BollywoodData/Bollywood-Data
 
## What i have done
After collecting the data, 
I import all the required libraries that is necessary for doing data analysis, 
I find how the female and male is described or showed in the movies,
I find what the female and male do in the filim, 
Then i find the mention centrality of the genders and the centrality of the genders in the movie, 
Finally the songs used in filim and which gender sang, 
Then i made a model using Randomforest regressor with good accuracy and pickled it to deploy the app in streamlit,
app.py is the streamlit file or the app file that we use to deploy the model file is too big to upload so we have a zip file thats the reason why i cant deploy it remotely.

## Conclusion:
I think that the first two analysis is enough for the directors to understand what is common and think of new stories or breake some stereotypes present.

## output:
We need count , average centrality and mentions as input
