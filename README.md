# Bollowood gender stereotype analysis
Finding:
The presence of gender stereotypes in many aspects of society is a well-known phenomenon in Indian movies.


The dataset is collected from : https://github.com/BollywoodData/Bollywood-Data
Test the app here:

After collecting the data, 
I import all the required libraries that is necessary for doing data analysis, 
I find how the female and male is described or showed in the movies,
I find what the female and male do in the filim, 
Then i find the mention centrality of the genders and the centrality of the genders in the movie, 
Finally the songs used in filim and which gender sang 

Conclusion:
I think that the first two analysis is enough for the directors to understand what is common and think of new stories or breake some stereotypes present.
